# Magno Blog
This is the code for [my personal website](https://magnoblog.netlify.com) hosted
in [Netlify](https://netlify.com) using the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org).
static site generator.

The HTML, CSS and JS were all created by me, I am not using a _theme_.

# TODOs
## Improvements:
- Improve the footer in shorter pages
- Diferent sized imgs

- In the categories bar, add a view for the subcategories when the list is too
  large.
- Table scaling in small devices
- Remove margin to hx when they are subsequent.

## Code:
- Reduce the duplicates in CSS

## New features:
- Reference link in information
- Add Russian chars to the animation (?)
- CSS Transitions / Animations

## When adding content:
- Add proper social media links
- Render `.odt` files to `.pdf` and then use the [converter](https://pdf2md.morethan.io)
